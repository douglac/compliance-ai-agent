# MongoDB Integration Summary

## Overview

Successfully integrated MongoDB with the Next.js application, connecting the Clients and Companies pages to real database data from the `compliance_db` MongoDB database.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. MongoDB Connection Utility

**File:** `/lib/mongodb.ts`

- Created a connection utility with connection pooling for serverless functions
- Implements connection caching to reuse connections across requests
- Exports `getDatabase()` and `getClient()` helper functions
- Uses environment variables for configuration

### 2. Environment Configuration

**File:** `.env.local` (needs to be created manually)
Required environment variables:

```bash
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017
MONGODB_DATABASE=compliance_db
```

### 3. Companies API Route

**File:** `/app/api/companies/route.ts`

- Removed mock data
- Queries MongoDB `clients` collection where `type="Corporate"`
- Returns corporate clients as companies
- Includes error handling

### 4. Companies Page UI

**File:** `/app/dashboard/companies/page.tsx`
Updated to display MongoDB client schema fields:

- **Company Name** - Corporate client name
- **Risk Level** - Badge with color coding (Low=green, Medium=yellow, High=red)
- **Net Worth** - Formatted as currency
- **Onboarding Date** - Date client was added
- **Last Review** - Date of last compliance review
- **Investment Preferences** - Shows preferences with count badge

### 5. Clients API Route

**File:** `/app/api/clients/route.ts`

- Removed mock data
- Queries MongoDB `clients` collection where `type="Individual"`
- Returns individual clients
- Includes error handling

### 6. Clients Page UI

**File:** `/app/dashboard/clients/page.tsx`
Updated to display MongoDB client schema fields:

- **Client Name** - Individual client name with avatar
- **Risk Level** - Badge with color coding
- **Net Worth** - Formatted as currency
- **Onboarding Date** - Date client was added
- **Last Review** - Date of last compliance review
- **Preferred Contact Times** - Shows time preferences with count badge

## Database Schema Used

Based on the MongoDB `clients` collection schema from `DATABASE.md`:

```typescript
{
  id: string,
  name: string,
  type: "Individual" | "Corporate",
  risk_level: "Low" | "Medium" | "High",
  net_worth: number,
  onboarding_date: Date,
  last_review_date: Date,
  preferred_contact_times: string[],
  investment_preferences: string[]
}
```

## How It Works

1. **Companies Page** displays clients where `type="Corporate"`
2. **Clients Page** displays clients where `type="Individual"`
3. Both pages use the same underlying MongoDB collection but filter by type
4. The UI has been adapted to show the actual database schema fields instead of the original mock data fields

## Next Steps

1. **Create `.env.local` file** with MongoDB connection settings:

   ```bash
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017
   MONGODB_DATABASE=compliance_db
   ```

2. **Ensure MongoDB is running** with the seeded data:

   ```bash
   # From the agent directory
   npm run seed-mongodb
   ```

3. **Start the Next.js development server**:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Visit the pages**:
   - Companies: http://localhost:3000/dashboard/companies
   - Clients: http://localhost:3000/dashboard/clients

## Dependencies Added

- `mongodb` - Official MongoDB Node.js driver (installed with --legacy-peer-deps)

## Files Modified

1. `/lib/mongodb.ts` - New file
2. `/app/api/companies/route.ts` - Updated
3. `/app/api/clients/route.ts` - Updated
4. `/app/dashboard/companies/page.tsx` - Updated
5. `/app/dashboard/clients/page.tsx` - Updated
6. `package.json` - MongoDB dependency added

## Error Handling

All API routes include try-catch blocks that:

- Log errors to the console
- Return appropriate HTTP 500 status codes
- Provide user-friendly error messages

## Performance Considerations

- Connection pooling is enabled (10 max, 5 min pool size)
- Connections are cached and reused across serverless function invocations
- No unnecessary database connections are created
