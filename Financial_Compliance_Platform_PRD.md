## Problem Statement

### Current Pain Points in Financial Services

1. **Manual Compliance Tracking**
   - 60% of compliance officers' time spent on manual document review
   - Average $500K annual cost for mid-size firms
   - 3-6 month implementation for new compliance systems

2. **Regulatory Risk Exposure**
   - $6.6 billion in regulatory fines (2023, up 57% YoY)
   - Average penalty for compliance violations: $100K-$1M
   - Missed deadlines lead to account restrictions and client dissatisfaction

3. **Fragmented Client Information**
   - Client data scattered across 5-10 systems
   - No unified view of compliance status
   - Manual cross-referencing required for every decision

4. **Lack of Proactive Intelligence**
   - Reactive approach to compliance issues
   - No predictive alerts for expiring documents
   - Missing relationship insights between entities

### Market Opportunity

- **Total Addressable Market:** $12.5B compliance software market
- **Growth Rate:** 15% CAGR through 2028
- **ROI Metrics:** 320-612% typical return on investment
- **Time to Value:** 1 week deployment vs 6 months industry standard

## Technical Implementation Details

### Backend Architecture

```javascript
// CrewAI Agent Configuration
const complianceAnalyst = new Agent({
  role: "Senior Compliance Officer",
  goal: "Ensure 100% regulatory compliance",
  backstory: "20 years of financial compliance experience",
  tools: [documentValidator, riskCalculator, regulatoryDB],
  memory: true
});

const crew = new Crew({
  agents: [complianceAnalyst, relationshipMapper, documentParser, insightGenerator],
  process: Process.hierarchical,
  memory: true,
  embedder: {
    provider: "openai",
    config: { model: "text-embedding-3-small" }
  }
});
```

### Knowledge Graph Query Example

```cypher
// Find all clients with expiring documents
MATCH (c:Client)-[:HAS_DOCUMENT]->(d:Document)
WHERE d.expiry_date <= date() + duration({days: 30})
  AND c.tenant_id = $tenantId
RETURN c.name, d.type, d.expiry_date,
       SIZE((c)-[:INTERESTED_IN]->(:Product)) as product_interests
ORDER BY d.expiry_date ASC
```

### API Endpoint Structure

```typescript
// /api/compliance/status
export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const { clientId } = await request.json();
  
  // Multi-agent orchestration
  const complianceCheck = await crew.kickoff({
    inputs: { 
      clientId, 
      checkType: "comprehensive",
      includeRelationships: true 
    }
  });
  
  // Graph traversal for relationships
  const relationships = await neo4j.query(
    RELATIONSHIP_QUERY, 
    { clientId }
  );
  
  // Vector similarity for relevant documents
  const relevantDocs = await chromadb.similaritySearch(
    complianceCheck.context,
    { k: 5 }
  );
  
  return NextResponse.json({
    status: complianceCheck.status,
    risks: complianceCheck.risks,
    recommendations: complianceCheck.actions,
    relationships,
    documents: relevantDocs
  });
}
```
